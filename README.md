# libqmap
> A small library for in-memory hashtables or dictionaries

## Installation
> Check out [these instructions](https://github.com/tty-pt/ci/blob/main/docs/install.md#install-ttypt-packages).

## Usage
If you have an editor that uses a language server, then you'll get help about the functions. But I highly encourage that you check out the [header files](https://github.com/tty-pt/qmap/blob/main/include/qmap.h), because I aim to document the library well there.
